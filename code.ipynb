    "   - Highlight **Rich Dad** and **Poor Dad** in bold for clarity.  \n",
    "   - Ensure the user's question appears in bold to differentiate it from the answer.\n",

      "**\"I finished Ironhack Bootcamp and I invest on my education. How can I earn the money I spent?\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "To earn back the money you invested in your education, focus on developing financial intelligence and leveraging your skills to create assets that generate income. Rather than just working a job, consider how you can apply what you've learned to build wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Comparison:**  \n",
      "- **Rich Dad Approach**: Emphasizes building financial intelligence by investing time in learning about assets and creating them. This could mean starting a business or investing in real estate or other ventures that grow your wealth over time without being heavily taxed.\n",
      "- **Poor Dad Approach**: Focuses on traditional employment and saving what's left after taxes. This approach limits potential growth since savings are typically subject to lower interest rates and taxes.\n",
      "- **Why Rich Dad's Approach is Better**: The emphasis is on using financial knowledge to create income-generating assets, which can exponentially grow wealth compared to relying solely on salary increases and savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy:**  \n",
      "Think of your education as planting seeds in a garden. The **Rich Dad** approach is like nurturing these seeds into fruit-bearing trees, providing continual harvests (income). Meanwhile, the **Poor Dad** approach is akin to picking the occasional flower—nice but not sustaining long-term.\n",
